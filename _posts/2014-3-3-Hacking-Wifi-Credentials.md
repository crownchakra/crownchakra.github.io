# Checking Wi-Fi Credentials Using PowerShell

## Introduction

In today's digital age, Wi-Fi connectivity is essential for staying connected to the internet, whether at home, at work, or on the go. Windows operating systems store Wi-Fi network credentials to make it easier for users to reconnect to known networks. However, there may be occasions when you need to access or verify these saved Wi-Fi credentials. In this guide, we will explore how to check Wi-Fi credentials using PowerShell, a powerful command-line tool available on Windows. By the end of this tutorial, you'll be equipped with the knowledge to retrieve Wi-Fi passwords, troubleshoot connectivity issues, and automate Wi-Fi tasks, all through the command-line interface.

## Section 1: Getting Started

Before we dive into the world of PowerShell and Wi-Fi credentials, let's ensure that you have everything you need to get started.

### Prerequisites

To follow along with this tutorial, you'll need:

- A Windows computer with administrative privileges.
- Basic familiarity with the Windows operating system.
- PowerShell installed, which is available on all modern Windows versions.

Now that we have the essentials in place, let's begin exploring how to list available Wi-Fi networks using PowerShell.

## Section 2: Listing Available Wi-Fi Networks

To interact with Wi-Fi networks through PowerShell, we'll be using the `Netsh` (Network Shell) command, a versatile tool for network configuration and management. Here's how to use PowerShell to list all available Wi-Fi networks:

```powershell
# Open PowerShell with administrative privileges
# To list available Wi-Fi networks, run:
netsh wlan show networks
